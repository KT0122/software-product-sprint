      <h2>Who am I?</h2>
      <p>I was born in the Dominican Republic back in 2001 and lived there until I was in the second grade when I moved to New York. I lived in and went to school in Queens till I was in Highschool, where I still lived in Queens but went to school in Harlem right at the end of the 3 train line. It was there that I fell in love with Computer Science, I learned how to lead, and I began this chapter of my life</p>
